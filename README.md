## Project Introduction
### Motivation
Musicians have long been hampered by the challenge of turning sheet music while their hands are occupied in playing an instrument. For years, human page turners, i.e., a person whose sole purpose is to turn pages for the musician, have been the preferred method of solving this challenge. In more recent years, expensive assistive technologies such as foot pedals, voice and eye-controlled switches have come into use and grown in popularity. However, these assistive methods rely on some form of gesture that the musician must remember while turning a page, which can be a source of distraction in concerts. Moreover, both human and assistive approaches are prone to failure due to their propensity for mistakes and accidental usage or non-usage.

In this project, we propose to solve this issue by making the process of page turning fully automatic. This is done by means of an embedded system, which tracks and maps hand and finger movements to the music that is being played in real time. This will ensure for more accurate and stress-free page turning, and an overall pleasant experience for both the musician and the audience.

### Goal
To build an embedded system that consists of a glove and a tablet/computer to automatically turn electronic pages of sheet music in real-time
### Deliverables
1) A glove-like wearable device that detects which fingers are used and their positions
2) Page-turning software that uses data from the wearable device and compares it with sheet music being used in order to turn pages
3) A demonstration of the automatic page turner in action in the form of a video and report.
