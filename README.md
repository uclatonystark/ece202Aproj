## Project Introduction
### Motivation
Musicians have long been disadvantaged by having to turn their sheet music whilst their hands are occupied on the instrument. Professional musicians performing a complex score have typically relied on human page-turners, who must be alert and skilled to gauge the musician’s preferences.

In recent years, expensive assistive technologies involving foot pedals, voice and eye-controlled devices have emerged and grown in popularity. However, these methods rely on a gesture or action initiated by the musician to trigger a page-turn, which can be distracting in a concert setting. Further, the human and assistive approaches are both prone to error from inattention, omission or incorrect use.

In this project, we propose to solve this centuries-old problem by rendering the process of page turn entirely automatic. This is achieved by an embedded system that recognizes and maps the musician’s hand and finger movements to the music playing in real time. This makes the page-turn precise and stress-free, allowing the musicians to focus on the creative aspects of the program.

### Goal
To build an embedded system that consists of a glove and a tablet/computer to automatically turn electronic pages of sheet music in real-time
### Deliverables
1) A glove-like wearable device that detects which fingers are used and their positions
2) Page-turning software that uses data from the wearable device and compares it with sheet music being used in order to turn pages
3) A demonstration of the automatic page turner in action in the form of a video and report.
