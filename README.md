## Project Introduction
### Motivation
Often time piano players have to rely on external devices or people to turn pages for them. They either have to pay a lot to hire someone or for a huge device to turn pages for them. Although recent technological advancement allows players to use a pedal to turn 'pages' on a tablet, it still distracts the players by having them to press the pedal while reading the music sheet and playing. Moreover, sound detecting devices might be able to capture players' music and make prediction on turning pages. However, that would not work in an environment where multiple players are playing at once in the same room. 

Overall, we concluded that a better approach will be to estimate the position of the notes being played. To do that, we propose a glove (gloves) filled with sensors that can detect the position of wrist, positions of fingers, and which fingers are used. This method allows players to not have to install sensors all over the piano. 
### Goal
As an entry point, we are trying to achieve key position estimation on two octaves (C3 to C5 for example) with white keys only.
